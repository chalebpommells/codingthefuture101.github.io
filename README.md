        <h1>TFONL Luv's Coding</h1>
        <p>Presently, there is no funding available from local high schools to support coding clubs. In Miami Gardens, computer classes are limited to only one AP computer science class offered for students. We need more opportunities for kids to learn computer programming while in high school to open up education and their exposure to potential career opportunities in their future. This club will use the open source Code Club World curriculum.</p>

          <p>The annual cost of the program for the 2017-2018 school year is anticipated to cost $2000, which covers the licensing costs of the progamme software. The two instructors have graciously donated their time at no cost.
